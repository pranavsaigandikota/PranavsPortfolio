# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to the home of all things *me*!  
This repo holds the code behind my personal portfolio website, where I showcase my projects, skills, and occasional attempts at looking professional online.

🚀 **Check out the live site:** [pranavsaigandikota.github.io/PranavsPortfolio](https://pranavsaigandikota.github.io/PranavsPortfolio/)  
(Warning: May cause sudden bursts of inspiration or mild envy (its still in development btw))

Feel free to poke around, admire the code, and maybe even reach out unless you're here to steal my coffee. ☕️
